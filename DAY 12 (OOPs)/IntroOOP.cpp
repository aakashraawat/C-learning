// Priciple of Object oriented programming 

//1. ABSTRACTION : // dont know the working just enjoy the fumvwe know the function name inside the class but dont know the working

//2. Encapsulation : // avoiding from miss handling we hide the data and function together inside class 
                    // function are visible and data is hiden the enscaptulation

//3. Inheritence  : You have a class Car and all the companies  BMW,Mercedes , bugatti inherit all features from class car and some of there own functiions


//4. Polymorphism

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;


class car {

    // 1. DATA


    //2.  Function ()

}
